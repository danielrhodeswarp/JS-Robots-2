<h2>What is JS Robots?</h2>
<p>It's a JavaScript <em>reimagining</em> of Tom Poindexter's seminal <a href="http://corewar.co.uk/crobots">CROBOTS</a> game.
You program a script to control a robot and then put your robot up to fight against other CPU or human controlled robots each with various scripts!</p>
<h2>Is this going to work in my browser?</h2>
<p>Famous last words perhaps but it's worked in every browser I've tested it with.
Namely the latest versions of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chromium on Linux</li>
	<li>Firefox on Linux</li>
	<li>Opera on Linux</li>
	<li>Chrome on Windows</li>
	<li>Firefox on Windows</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer on Windows</li>
	<li>Opera on Windows</li>
	<li>Safari on Windows</li>
	<li>Dolphin Browser on Android (slow)</li>
	<li>Opera Mobile on Android (super slow)</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsers vary wildy in their JavaScript performance and especially with HTML5 canvas.
HTML5 audio performance varies most of all though, with some browsers not playing
the sounds at all! (Though this might be because they are in WAV format...)</p>

	<tr><td>0.4gh</td><td>November 2011</td><td>First version of <a href="https://github.com/danielrhodeswarp/JS-Robots">JS Robots in GitHub</a>. Essentially as v0.85 minus any Twitter functionality and packaged to work purely from local files in the browser.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0.85</td><td>October 2011</td><td><a href="http://twitter.com/jsrobots">Twitter hall of fame</a> working again. It had stopped working since Twitter moved to oAuth only (which was a very long time ago!).</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0.8</td><td>July 2011</td><td>Mostly cosmetic / internal revamp.
	<ul>
	<li>Now using HTML5 for text markup (but not using <a href="http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/">HTML5 canvas</a> for drawing onto the arena - though
	this is a great TODO!)</li>
	<li><a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> now going on (very arbitrarily) in the background as a bit of personal practice.</li>
	<li>Now on jQuery 1.6.2, although I see that this is quite a bit fatter than 1.3.2! jQuery is used for
	things like arena element sizing and auto onloading.</li>
	<!-- <li>Trashed the Twitter hall of fame (though I might get back to this as an onsite thing)</li>-->

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span class="linethrough">HTML5 canvas</span> [done!]</li>
	<li>Concurrency, concurrency, concurrency! (Web Workers? NodeJS?)</li>
	<li>Some kind of sandbox for robot script development / debugging...?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>There's a pretty irritating bug which we call the <em>quick getaway bug</em>.
Basically, if your robot's speed is zero due to colliding with another robot, then
you need to drive() away as soon as possible in the code rather than waiting for the next iteration.
See the presets for examples.</p> 
<p>Possibly related to the above, there's also the <em>jitterbug bug</em>.
A robot will <em>occasionally</em> jitter back and forth when in front of a wall or other robot.</p> 
<p><span class="linethrough">Another irritating bug is that starting the game again after a stop or game win <em>isn't</em> perfect unfortunately.
Best to reload the URL</span> [fixed!]</p> 
<h2>Behind the site</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://naioo.com/blog/rss-robot-icon"><em>Cute robot</em> icon</a> as used for the game sprites and favicon is by Henning at the wonderful <a href="http://naioo.com/blog/">naioo.com blog</a>.
	I really like this kind of "future cute" style!</li>
	<li>Icons on buttons and links are from the rather excellent <a href="http://famfamfam.com">Famfamfam</a> icon sets</li>
	<li>Top left planet is a public domain image by NASA simulating what an ice age on mars might look like</li>
	<li>Bottom most image is a public domain image by NASA of an actual martian landscape</li>
	<li>Gradient between the above two images was knocked up by myself using HTML5 canvas (and Firefox's "Save Image As" capability on HTML5 canvases!)</li>
	<li>CSS3 stretches the martian landscape image to fit the browser width</li>
	<li>Sounds are from <a href="http://soungle.com">soungle.com</a> which is a search engine for royalty free sound effects</li>
	<li>The robots and their weaponry are animated using HTML5 canvas</li>
	<li>The arena background is a colourised picture of a <a href="http://www.google.com/mars/">Google Mars</a> snippet</li>
	<li>The site is laid out using <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a></li>
</ul>
