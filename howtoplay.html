<h2>What is JS Robots?</h2> 
<p>It's a JavaScript <em>reimagining</em> of Tom Poindexter's seminal <a href="http://corewar.co.uk/crobots">CROBOTS</a> game.
You program a script to control a robot and then put your robot up to fight against other CPU or human controlled robots each with various scripts!</p> 

<h2>Quick start</h2> 
<ul> 
	<li>You need at least two robot players to battle (CPU and / or Human - it doesn't matter)</li> 
	<li>Tick the checkboxes to enable various robots</li> 
	<li>CPU robots must use one of the preset scripts</li> 
	<li>Human players can create a script from scratch, use a preset or edit a preset</li> 
	<li>Press the play button!</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Game arena and buttons</h2>
<img src="img/arena_and_buttons.gif" alt="">
<ul>
	<li>The top left button toggles the sound on or off.
	Note that depending on your browser / operating system you might not get sounds
	anyway :-(
	</li>
	<li>The restart button starts a fresh game and will pick up any changes
	to the selected robot scripts
	</li>
	<li>The top right button starts the very first game and also pauses / resumes
	the current game
	</li>
	<li>Your robot will get damaged if an explosion touches it or if it hits
	the edge of the arena or another robot
	</li>
</ul>


<h2>Robot script tutorial</h2>
<h3>OK, let's write our first JS Robots script!</h3>
<p>Let's write a robot that scans clockwise incrementally and launches a missile
at any target found. Let's also move closer to the target if it far away and
move away from the target if it is close.</p>
<p>Right, here's how we scan clockwise incrementally (and nothing else!):</p>
<code class="block">if(!this.scanAngle)	//ie. first time round
{
	this.scanAngle = 0;	//initial value
}

//scan() returns false if nothing in scan line OR
//an integer representing the distance to the CLOSEST
//robot in the scan line 
var range = this.scan(this.scanAngle, 5);	//variance of +/- 5 degrees

//Have target
if(range)
{
	//fire missile and move closer / away as necessary
}

this.scanAngle += 10;	//move scanner 10 degrees clockwise
</code>
<p>We save the scanAngle variable to <em>this</em> (which means the robot)
because we want to remember the value between iterations - so that we can increment it.
We dont save the range variable to <em>this</em> because it's a throwaway value
that is going to change each iteration anyway.</p>
<p>Note how we initialise the scanAngle variable by checking for its existence and,
if it doesn't exist, creating it and setting its initial value.</p>
<p>Then we use the robot's scan() method to scan for enemy robots. We specify a
variance of 5 degrees so, in this instance, we are actually scanning from
355 to 5 degrees.
The scan() method returns false if no enemy robots were detected, and so
<code>if(range){/*do something*/}</code> is a code block that executes when we
DO have an enemy robot in sight. We'll come back to this code block.</p>
<p>Finally, we increment the scan angle by 10 degrees.</p>
<p>If you run this script as a player in the game (perhaps against a single,
harmless CPU player), you can see that the "Scan" on the human player statistics table
is counting up as we would expect.</p>

<h3>Adding some firepower!</h3>
<p>At the minute we're just standing still and scanning around. We're a sitting duck!
Let's launch a missile at any enemy robots we detect with our scan.</p>
<p>Add to the code block we just talked about so that it looks like this:</p>
<code class="block">//Have target
if(range)
{
	this.cannon(this.scanAngle, range);
}
</code>
<p>With the cannon() method we can launch a missile at the specified angle
and with the specified range (distance). The missile will travel at the given angle for the
given range and then explode.</p>
<p>What we do here is launch a missile at the current scanAngle and with
the range as returned previously by scan(). Scan() gives use the <em>exact</em>
range to the closest enemy robot BUT don't forget that we scanned with 5 degrees
of variance and so the enemy robot might not be exactly at scanAngle! The enemy robot
will no doubt be zipping around like a maniac too!</p>
<p>Your full script should now look like this:</p>
<code class="block">if(!this.scanAngle)	//ie. first time round
{
	this.scanAngle = 0;	//initial value
}

//scan() returns false if nothing in scan line OR
//an integer representing the distance to the CLOSEST
//robot in the scan line 
var range = this.scan(this.scanAngle, 5);	//variance of +/- 5 degrees

//Have target
if(range)
{
	this.cannon(this.scanAngle, range);
}

this.scanAngle += 10;	//move scanner 10 degrees clockwise
</code>
<p>If you run this script as a player in the game you can see that it is standing still
and scanning incrementally as before, but will now launch a missile if any enemy
robot is detected in its scan.
</p>

<h3>Put your left leg in, your right leg out...</h3>
<p>We can attack now, be we still don't move and so we're still a sitting duck!
Let's move closer to or away from any found target based on its distance from us.
Add to the <code>if(range)</code> code block so that it looks like this:
</p>
<code class="block">//Have target
if(range)
{
	this.cannon(this.scanAngle, range);
	
	if(range > 300)	//Move closer
	{
		this.drive(this.scanAngle, 75);
	}
	
	else if(range &lt; 200)	//Back off
	{
		this.drive(this.scanAngle, 0);
		this.drive(this.scanAngle - 180, 100);
	}
}
</code>
<p>We launch the missile as before. This time though we drive! The range variable
(from our prior call to scan() if you remember) is the distance from us to the closest
enemy robot. We drive differently depending on the value of this.
If the enemy robot is more than 300 units away, we drive - at scanAngle - with 75%
engine power. If the enemy robot is less than 200 units away, we do two things.
First, because changes in direction can only be negotiated at speeds of less than 50%,
we stop by driving with an engine power of zero. Then we drive in the direction <em>opposite</em>
to scanAngle by using scanAngle - 180. We drive away at 100% engine power.
</p>
<p>Extra credit if you've realised that there's an implied case of the enemy robot
being between 200 and 300 (inclusive) units away. In this case, the robot does
not move because we haven't specified so.</p>
<p>Your full script should now look like this:</p>
<code class="block">if(!this.scanAngle)	//ie. first time round
{
	this.scanAngle = 0;	//initial value
}

//scan() returns false if nothing in scan line OR
//an integer representing the distance to the CLOSEST
//robot in the scan line 
var range = this.scan(this.scanAngle, 5);	//variance of +/- 5 degrees

//Have target
if(range)
{
	this.cannon(this.scanAngle, range);
	
	if(range > 300)	//Move closer
	{
		this.drive(this.scanAngle, 75);
	}
	
	else if(range &lt; 200)	//Back off
	{
		this.drive(this.scanAngle, 0);
		this.drive(this.scanAngle - 180, 100);
	}
}

this.scanAngle += 10;	//move scanner 10 degrees clockwise
</code>

<p>If you run this script as a player in the game you can see that it is
launching missiles and scanning incrementally as before, but will now move
occasionally if the scanned enemy robot is very close or very far.
</p>

<h3>Finishing touches</h3>
<p>Our robot is pretty cool now! It could be much cooler though.
Have you noticed that it isn't attacking very often? Because it increments
the scanAngle even if a target has been found, acquired targets are very quickly
lost.</p>
<p>Let's "lock" the scanAngle if we have a target so that we can keep
pummelling the enemy robot! Replace the very last line of the script with this:</p>
<code class="block">else	//Only change scanning angle if we've lost the target
{
	this.scanAngle += 10;
}
</code>
<p>With this, we do our attacking and moving for acquired targets as before BUT increment
the scanAngle only if no targets were found.</p>
<p>Your full script should now look like this:</p>
<code class="block">if(!this.scanAngle)	//ie. first time round
{
	this.scanAngle = 0;	//initial value
}

//scan() returns false if nothing in scan line OR
//an integer representing the distance to the CLOSEST
//robot in the scan line 
var range = this.scan(this.scanAngle, 5);	//variance of +/- 5 degrees

//Have target
if(range)
{
	this.cannon(this.scanAngle, range);
	
	if(range > 300)	//Move closer
	{
		this.drive(this.scanAngle, 75);
	}
	
	else if(range &lt; 200)	//Back off
	{
		this.drive(this.scanAngle, 0);
		this.drive(this.scanAngle - 180, 100);
	}
}

else	//Only change scanning angle if we've lost the target
{
	this.scanAngle += 10;
}
</code>
<p>If you run this script as a player in the game you can see that it is
moving and launching missiles as before, but will now stay with the same target
for longer and <em>stalk</em> enemy robots more aggressively.
</p>
<p>By the way congratulations, you have just wrote the <strong>Hunting Sniper</strong> robot! ;-)</p>
<p>Be sure to check the other robot presets for more ideas. You'll also want
to check the below API reference to make a real killer robot!</p>

<h2>Robot scripting notes</h2> 
<ol>
<li>
<p class="important">Unfortunately, and this makes the game less playable and usable than it should
really be, robot scripts do not operate concurrently. Rather, each playing robot's
script executes once all the way through and then the next robot gets a turn
and so on. This sucks - and is not how the original CROBOTS operates - because
looping becomes unfair / impossible. Also, a longer script that attacks twice
and moves twice will tend to always beat a script that only moves and attacks once
BECAUSE the longer script is effectively getting more CPU time.</p>
<p>We are working on this (see the <a href="about.html">about</a> page), but for the time being the following types
of script should not be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conditional / endless while loops</strong> for example:</p>
<code class="block">//Init
if(!this.coord)
{
	this.coord = this.funcToGetACoord();
	this.heading = this.funcToGetHeadingForCoord(this.coord);
	this.finished = false;
}

//move to this.coord and then simply stop
while(!this.finished)
{
	this.drive(this.heading, 100);

	//Stop if close enough to desired coord
	if(this.funcToSeeIfCloseToCoord(this.coord))
	{
		this.drive(this.heading, 0);	//Stop
		this.finished = true;
	}

	//get new heading to coord if we have stopped for some reason
	else if(this.speed() == 0)
	{
		this.heading = this.funcToGetHeadingForCoord(this.coord);
		this.drive(this.heading, 100);	//For quick getaway bug
	}
}
</code>
<p>What will happen here is that <em>all</em> of this script will execute
on this robot's turn. The robot will indeed move to the initialised coordinate,
but will do so in the blink of an eye and will not actually appear to move! We are
basically hogging CPU time with this kind of loop. If you're feeling brave you can
modify the mosquito script to behave like this and you can see for yourself
how it doesn't move (but it has actually gone to the initialised coordinate).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For loops</strong> for example:</p>
<code class="block">//Init
if(!this.coord)
{
	this.coord = {x:250, y:250};
	this.heading = this.funcToGetHeadingForCoord(this.coord.x, this.coord.y);
	this.arrived = false;
	this.firedAlready = false;
}

if(!this.arrived)
{
	this.drive(this.heading, 100);

	//Stop if close enough to desired coord
	if(this.funcToSeeIfCloseToCoord(this.coord) )
	{
		this.drive(this.heading, 0);	//Stop
		this.arrived = true;
	}

	//get new heading if we stopped for whatever reason
	else if(this.speed() == 0)
	{
		this.heading = this.funcToGetHeadingForCoord(this.coord.x, this.coord.y);
		this.drive(this.heading, 100);	//For quick getaway bug
	}
}

else if(!this.firedAlready)	//arrived so go wild (once!)
{
	//sweep around and fire at different ranges for each angle
	for(var angle = 0; angle &lt; 360; angle += 5)
	{
		for(var range = 50; range &lt; 250; range += 10)
		{
			var fired = this.cannon(angle, range);
		}
	}

	this.firedAlready = true;
}
</code>
<p>What we do here is drive to the centre of the arena normally. We then use a couple
of for loops to launch missiles everywhere! We loop through a full circle and also
we loop through some different ranges for each angle of the circle. Luckily
missiles take a few turn to reload and so we only manage to get one off, but we
very definitely hog the CPU here. We could also be doing something other than firing
in the loops - scanning for the next target for example. Unfair!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Doing lots in one script</strong> for example:</p>
<code class="block">//init
var scanAngle = rand(360);
var fired = false;

var range = this.scan(scanAngle, 5);
if(range && !fired)
{
	this.cannon(scanAngle, range);
	fired = true;
}

this.scanAngle += 10;
var range = this.scan(scanAngle, 5);
if(range && !fired)
{
	this.cannon(scanAngle, range);
	fired = true;
}

this.scanAngle += 10;
var range = this.scan(scanAngle, 5);
if(range && !fired)
{
	this.cannon(scanAngle, range);
	fired = true;
}

this.scanAngle += 10;
var range = this.scan(scanAngle, 5);
if(range && !fired)
{
	this.cannon(scanAngle, range);
	fired = true;
}
</code>
<p>Here we hog the CPU by scanning and firing multiple times in one iteration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>To debug your robot script, you may use the log() function thus:</p>
<code class="block">log('some string');
log(this.someVariable);
log(this.loc_x());
</code>
</li>

<li>
<p>To remember things between iterations, save it to a member variable thus:
<code>this.somethingToRemember = whatever();</code></p> 
</li> 

<li>
<p>Robot object methods are documented (below) and internal housekeeping methods / members
are prefixed with a '_' [underscore]. Avoid these names for methods and variables in your own scripts and you will be fine.</p> 
</li>
 
<li>
<p>In your robot script, any and all JavaScript functions / objects / methods are available.
The static methods of the Math object might be especially useful.
Take a look at the <a href="http://devguru.com/technologies/javascript/home.asp">JavaScript guide on DevGuru</a>.
Be sure you don't, for example, alert() anything out though because it will end in tears!
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You can define a reusable method for your robot thus:<br/> 
<code class="block"> 
//Define
this.reusableMethod = function(speed)
{
	this.whatever = something();
	this.drive(90, speed);
}<span class="reverso">;</span> 
 
this.scan(this.scanAngle, 5);	//Other stuff here
 
//Use
this.reusableMethod(100);
</code> 
<br/> 
A semicolon after the method definition is required.
</p> 
</li>
</ol>

	<li>Arena size</li> 
	<li>Coordinate system</li> 
	<li>Compass system</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Details:</p>

	<li>The arena is a square of 500 units by 500 units</li> 
	<li>The top-left of the arena is (0,0). The bottom-right is (499,499).</li> 
	<li>The compass system is oriented so that due north (up) is 0 degrees, 90 is east,

</table>

<h2>Robot script API reference</h2> 
<h3>Per robot methods</h3> 
<p>Need to prefix these with <em>this.</em></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
	<strong>scan(degree, resolution)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	The scan() method scans for enemy robots at the specified degree and resolution.
	scan() returns false if no robots are within the scan line
	or a positive integer representing the distance to the <em>closest</em> robot.
	Degree should be within the range 0-359, otherwise degree is forced into 0-359 by a modulo 360 operation, and made positive if necessary.
	Resolution controls the scanner's sensing resolution, up to +/- 10 degrees.
	<br/><br/>Examples:<br/> 
	<code class="block"> 
var range = this.scan(45, 0);	//Scan the 45 degree line, with no variance
var range = this.scan(365, 10);	//Scans the lines from 355 degs to 15 degs
	</code> 
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>cannon(degree, range)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	The cannon() method fires a missile heading in the specified range and direction.
	cannon() returns true if a missile was fired, or false if the cannon is reloading.
	Degree is forced into the range 0-359 as in scan().
	Range can be 0-350, with greater ranges truncated to 350.
	<br/><br/>Examples:<br/> 
	<code class="block"> 
var degree = 45;	//Set a direction to test
 
if((var range = this.scan(degree, 2)) != false)	//See if a target is there
{
	this.cannon(degree, range);	//Fire a missile
}
	</code> 
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>drive(degree, speed)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	The drive() method activates the robot's drive mechanism, on the specified heading and speed.
	Degree is forced into the range 0-359 as in scan().
	Speed is expressed as a percent, with 100 as maximum.
	A speed of 0 disengages the drive.
	Changes in direction can be negotiated at speeds of less than 50 percent.
	<br/><br/>Examples:<br/> 
	<code class="block"> 
this.drive(0, 100);	//Head due north, at maximum speed
this.drive(90, 0);	//Stop motion
	</code> 
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>damage()</strong> 
	<br/> 
	The damage() method returns the current amount of damage incurred.
	damage() takes no arguments, and returns the integer percent of damage, 0-99.
	(100 percent damage means the robot is completely disabled, thus no longer running!)
	<br/><br/>Examples:<br/> 
	<code class="block"> 
var d = this.damage();	//Save current state
; ; ;				//Other instructions
if(d != this.damage())	//Compare current state to prior state
{
	this.drive(90, 100);	//Robot has been hit, start moving
	d = this.damage();	//Get current damage again
}
	</code> 
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>speed()</strong> 
	<br/> 
	The speed() method returns the current speed of the robot.
	speed() takes no arguments, and returns the integer percent of speed, 0-100.
	Note that speed() may not always be the same as the last drive(), because of acceleration and deacceleration.
	<br/><br/>Examples:<br/> 
	<code class="block"> 
this.drive(270, 100);	//Start drive, due west full speed
; ; ;				//Other instructions
if(this.speed() == 0)	//Check current speed
{
	this.drive(90, 20);	//Ran into the west wall, or another robot so backtrack east
}
	</code> 
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>loc_x() and loc_y()</strong> 
	<br/> 
	The loc_x() method returns the robot's current x axis location.
	loc_x() takes no arguments, and returns an integer in the range 0-499.
	The loc_y() method is similar to loc_x(), but returns the current y axis position.
	<br/><br/>Examples:<br/> 
	<code class="block"> 
if(this.loc_y() > 20)
{
	this.drive(0, 50);	//Start heading for north wall
}
 
else
{
	this.drive(0, 0);		//Stop drive
}
	</code> 
</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Utility functions</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> 
	<strong>rand(limit)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	Returns a random integer between zero and limit (exclusive).
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>sqrt(number)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	Returns the square root of a number. Number is made positive if necessary.
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>sine(degree)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	Returns the trigometric sine of degree (degree being an integer from zero to 359).
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>cosine(degree)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	Returns the trigometric cosine of degree (degree being an integer from zero to 359).
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>tan(degree)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	Returns the trigometric tangent of degree (degree being an integer from zero to 359).
</li> 
<li> 
	<strong>atan(ratio)</strong> 
	<br/> 
	Returns the integer degree value, between -90 and +90, of the ratio.
</li> 
</ul>
